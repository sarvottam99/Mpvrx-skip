### Audiobooks and Listening Progress

#### Local Audiobook Library

- **Dedicated library:** Browse books separately from songs with a unified top bar, search, sorting, list/grid views, covers, details, and metadata editing.
- **Single-file and folder imports:** Import individual files, including M4B, or folders containing multiple tracks and disc subfolders. Track ordering keeps a book together instead of treating each file as an unrelated song.
- **Book metadata:** Read supported embedded tags and sidecar metadata, including author/narrator information, covers, and chapters. Present the combined duration and listening position across the book's files.
- **Resume and completion:** Save the current book, track, position, and finished state across file transitions, background playback, and reopening the player.
- **Listening preferences:** Added book playback speed, configurable pause rewind, timed sleep, and end-of-chapter sleep behavior.
- **Library separation:** Added an `.audiobook` folder marker and music-scanner integration so recognized audiobook folders do not also clutter the normal song library.
- **Library removal:** Books can be removed from the audiobook library without treating that action as a request to delete their source media.

#### Shared Player and Bookmarks

- **One audio-player interface:** Books reuse the normal audio controls, seekbar, speed sheet, playlist, up-next presentation, gestures, and visualizers instead of opening an unrelated player layout.
- **Whole-book navigation:** Display book-relative progress and seek across track boundaries while retaining pause state. Book queues preserve their established file order rather than applying song-style shuffle and repeat.
- **Artwork and identity:** Show the book title, author/narrator, file titles, and cover artwork; portrait book covers use a fitted presentation instead of being forced into a cropped square.
- **Shared bookmarks:** Added persistent playback bookmarks for videos, music, and audiobooks, with add, name, rename, delete, list, and seek actions.
- **Bookmark controls:** Use the existing bookmark/chapter controls to open saved points and long-press to capture a named playback position, where the control is enabled.
- **Combined chapters:** Merge native/book chapters and custom bookmarks in the displayed timeline and seekbar markers without replacing the native chapter data used by automatic skipping. Audiobook chapters and files have dedicated navigation tabs.
- **Correct bookmark ownership:** Capture the actually loaded media identity and timestamp together so a queue transition cannot assign an outgoing position to the next item.
- **Supplied book text:** Reuse the lyrics view for supported embedded/local text without automatically searching or translating through online song-lyrics services.

#### Audiobookshelf

- **Server management:** Add, edit, select, and remove Audiobookshelf connections, with username/password or API-token authentication and library selection.
- **Remote browsing:** Browse and search server books with covers, book details, progress, sorting, and the audiobook list/grid presentation.
- **Shared playback:** Map remote tracks and chapters into the existing audiobook player so remote books use the same timeline, resume, chapter, and listening controls.
- **Progress synchronization:** Read server progress and synchronize listening position and finished state back to the server during playback and completion updates.
- **Consistent details:** Consolidated local and remote book details and improved Audiobookshelf JSON parsing. Remote entries remain separate from the local-book list.

### Music and Media Servers

#### Navidrome and Subsonic

- **New music-server support:** Connect to Navidrome and compatible Subsonic servers using the Subsonic REST API, including token/salt authentication and HTTPS connections.
- **Library browsing:** Browse songs, albums, artists, playlists, and detail sheets through shared music components rather than a separate playback interface.
- **Queues and favorites:** Improved server-backed queue operations and favorite synchronization for Navidrome and Jellyfin music.
- **Independent presentation:** Preserve provider-specific music view and sort preferences.
- **Music source selection:** Switch between local music and configured supported servers from the music interface. Hide redundant or unavailable source controls and show the correct subtabs for the selected provider.

#### Jellyfin and Seerr

- **Per-library home sections:** Show dynamic Latest sections for individual libraries, with fallback handling when a server does not return the expected grouped results.
- **Series-aware browsing:** Group show entries as series with appropriate posters and season information, improve series filtering, and avoid duplicated recommendations and hero items.
- **Smarter episode actions:** Resume an in-progress episode, continue with the next unwatched episode, or restart from the detail sheet instead of treating every series selection as the same first episode.
- **Reliable watch state:** Corrected playback tracking timestamps, progress synchronization, and automatic refresh of watched/resume state.
- **Richer detail sheets:** Show cast, directors, writers, and producers. Open a person's details and filmography from their credits.
- **Detail presentation:** Refined hero year badges, title clipping, restart actions, and storyline expansion. Read more appears only when the text actually overflows.
- **Separate browsing state:** Selecting Jellyfin music no longer takes over the main Jellyfin browser's home state; music subtabs remain available in the music-source view.
- **Seerr request profiles:** Fetch Radarr/Sonarr quality profiles for requests and provide a profile picker instead of relying only on a server default.
- **Correct availability:** Improved Seerr's disconnected presentation and the status of media that has been deleted from the library.
- **Server settings:** Added a dedicated media-server settings experience with inline connections, profile avatars, and overflow actions.

#### Music Browsing and Playback

- **Track information:** Added audio-format and quality badges, playlist total duration, and immediate display of known track duration instead of waiting unnecessarily for playback.
- **Artwork sizing:** Added configurable music-grid cover size and improved edge-to-edge artwork in playlist rows, responsive player artwork, and tablet portrait cover scaling.
- **Scoped-storage discovery:** Restore songs whose MediaStore entries do not expose a usable direct filesystem path, using content URIs rather than discarding valid entries on Android 10 and later.
- **Mini-player controls:** Added an option to switch songs from the background mini player.
- **Queue interactions:** Refined playlist scrolling, reordering, selection, and playback actions, with more consistent favorites handling.
- **Lyrics timing:** Recognize whole-second embedded LRC timestamps in the synchronized-lyrics view and improve multilingual text rendering.
- **Less network work:** Limit automatic lyrics lookup to audio, avoid remote metadata-retriever probes, and deduplicate active requests.

### Downloads, Streaming, and Playlists

#### Download Manager

- **Download queue:** Added a Downloads screen with queued items, progress, notifications, thumbnails, and pause/resume/cancel controls where supported by the download engine.
- **Destination selection:** Choose a download folder through Android's storage picker and track downloads from the Network and Jellyfin entry points.
- **Link downloads:** Download from the Play Link sheet and network recent entries. Direct files use the download queue, while supported HLS/DASH and extractor links use the yt-dlp foreground-service path; magnet links retain the torrent workflow.
- **YouTube quality:** Added downloads from the selected quality/rendition, including pairing and merging separate video/audio streams and improved finalization of completed files.
- **Responsive enqueueing:** Move download enqueue work off the UI path and improve progress, thumbnail, and completion handling.

#### Jellyfin Offline Media

- Download individual episodes, whole seasons, and complete series from the media details workflow.
- Save supported external subtitles as sidecar files alongside downloaded video.
- Show downloaded-state badges and prefer completed local downloads, with their subtitles, when playback is opened again.
- Improved Jellyfin download handling alongside player lifecycle and wake-lock fixes.

#### Connections and Playlist Sources

- **Xtream Codes:** Added credential-based Xtream Codes playlist import alongside the existing playlist sources.
- **Connection editor:** Replaced separate add/edit dialogs with a shared, keyboard-aware sheet, protocol-specific ports, validation, and appropriate anonymous/HTTPS controls.
- **Password edits:** Preserve an existing connection password when the replacement field is left blank; provide an explicit clear-password action.
- **URL handling:** Improved server URL resolution and protocol hints so connection setup better handles entered hostnames, URLs, schemes, and default ports.
- **Accessible connection actions:** Keep connection menus and actions clear of the floating Add button.
- **Recent torrents:** Save torrent source links in recent playback history.
- **Resolved sources:** Analyze the actual resolved playlist source instead of applying metadata/analysis work to the wrong wrapper URL.
- **Fewer repeated requests:** Avoid redundant remote loads and video-track reselection during surface handoffs, while retaining normal reconnect and replacement-load behavior.

#### yt-dlp Installation

- Restore compatible detection of existing installed yt-dlp files and keep the legacy shell wrapper optional during runtime preparation.
- Validate a newly downloaded candidate with the bundled runtime before replacing the installed file; retain the previous installation if validation fails.
- Serialize installation/update preparation and avoid duplicate operations.
- Show selectable, bounded diagnostic output in yt-dlp Streaming settings when installation or updating fails instead of only leaving the app in a Not Installed state.

### Player Controls and Playback

#### Controls and Layout

- **Optional controls drawer:** Added a setting to show or hide the controls drawer and standardized its heading as Controls drawer.
- **Stable action grid:** Keep the drawer's three-column layout intact at different display densities and make the Cast icon inherit the same foreground colors as neighboring controls.
- **Overlay indicators:** Keep indicators near the visible controls, then move them upward when controls hide. Use a slimmer pill and compact text-only hold-speed feedback.
- **Locked playback:** Simplified unlocking and improved interactions with player controls and playlists.
- **Consistent sheets:** Standardized drag handles, titles, section headers, metadata spacing, touch targets, navigation-bar insets, and scrolling across player sheets, including equalizer and audio-properties dialogs.
- **Familiar tool placement:** Retained audio tools beside Add external audio, subtitle tools beside Add external subtitles, and the previous More action arrangement. External subtitle translate/remove controls remain directly accessible.
- **Room for controls:** Let audio channel choices and aspect/post-processing options wrap, keep scopes scrollable, and remove unnecessarily restrictive height limits from ambience and post-processing sheets.
- **Draggable panels:** Retained the 380 dp maximum width while improving safe-area padding, drag targets, available portrait height, scroll bounds, and horizontal positioning.
- **Chapter availability:** Configured chapter/bookmark buttons remain visible but disabled when the combined chapter/bookmark list is empty.
- **Portrait layout:** Refined header alignment, status indicators, audio controls, and artwork sizing without replacing the familiar audio/video control layout.

#### Seeking and Playback State

- **Resume modes:** Added Always, Ask, and Never. Ask begins at the start and offers the saved position in an actionable pill; resume/start-afresh feedback respects the resume-indicator preference.
- **Fast double taps:** Keep non-precise seeking fast and handle requests near the end of a file without introducing unnecessary repeated seeks.
- **Configured speed restoration:** Restore the user-selected default speed after a temporary hold-speed gesture rather than always forcing 1x.
- **Gesture presentation:** Hide the bottom seekbar during horizontal gesture seeking when the main controls are hidden, and keep zoom/pan transformations synchronized with the player.
- **Frame-review feedback:** Replace the large central frame-delta overlay with a signed value beside the bottom frame counter. Forward/backward changes use distinct colors and fade after interaction, while snapshots remain available.
- **Initial orientation:** Honor requested rotation before the first layout and improve wake-lock and controls handling during playback transitions.
- **Song-to-video handoff:** Prevent stale outgoing-song state from selecting the music interface or hiding the video surface while a new video is being prepared, addressing the active-playback recurrence of .
- **Video startup:** Keep GPU video output disabled until an Android surface is attached, preserving the configured renderer and addressing the missing-surface failure reported in .

#### Notifications and Skip Markers

- Use Android's progress-notification style in place of the custom progress layout, with clearer chapter progress and artwork placement.
- Improve notification updates, queue transitions, background-session ownership, and chapter progress reporting.
- Added SkipDB to the skip-marker provider options and improved marker validation and merging.
- Guard asynchronous intro lookups against media changes so a previous file's results cannot replace the current file's markers.
- Hide manual skip pills when the corresponding automatic action is enabled: intro/recap follow auto-intro, and outro/credits/preview follow auto-outro. Preference changes also update paused playback without removing timeline markers.

### Audio Visualizers and Video Processing

#### Audio Visualization

- **Wavy seekbar:** Added a configurable traveling wave for the played portion of the audio seekbar, with a dim remaining track, playhead dot, interactive seeking, and a smooth flattened pause state.
- **Reactive ribbons:** Drive ribbons from low, mid, and high audio bands and current output volume, with beat pulses and improved thickness, speed, edge joining, and seekbar-color matching.
- **Light and dark appearance:** Use transparent rendering and contrast-aware colors so visualizers blend with the current artwork/ambient background in both themes.
- **Responsive stage:** Refined existing Blob, Galaxy, Cuboid, and Particle rendering, removed unnecessary insets, and preserved separate artwork/control sizing. The upper visualizer can extend behind the status bar.
- **Paused rendering:** Fixed the frozen spectrum spike in the Blob visualizer and improved renderer/surface handling.
- **Visualizer cleanup:** Removed the Musializer mode while retaining and refining the supported visualizers.

#### Media Scopes

- Added selected-audio-track multichannel waveform analysis and real-time luma, RGBY, and vectorscope views in the video player.
- Added responsive scope overlays, keyboard access, and localized controls.
- Expose analysis resolution and frame-rate settings so scope quality and processing cost can be adjusted for the device.

#### Post-Processing

- Added a dedicated post-processing player control and settings sheet with preset descriptions and expandable parameter controls.
- Included Natural, Vivid, Anime, Clean, Cel Shaded, Cartoon, Cinematic, Dreamy, Retro, Bloom, Scanlines, White Balance, and Film styles, plus None. Some preset chains are ports of Eden effects.
- Added 22 GLSL effects for combinations of sharpening, levels, color grading, denoising, cel/cartoon processing, bloom/blur, filmic tone, grain, debanding, lens effects, scanlines, split toning, vignette, and white balance.
- Allow per-effect tuning through persistent sliders, with debounced live shader rebuilding and integration into mpv's shader chain across playback and PiP.
- Updated HDR Toys tone-mapping and transfer-function shaders, including additional tone-mapping implementations.

#### Crop, Ambient, and Decoding

- Expanded automatic black-bar cropping to supported online playback through active-player analysis.
- Avoid stale online crop-cache reuse and analyze resolved playlist sources correctly. Use a standard switch in the automatic-crop setting.
- Center ambient video bounds, derive the ambient presentation from post-crop geometry, and refresh it when crop state changes.
- Preserve ambient backgrounds during visualizer playback and improve surface handoff to external displays.
- Restrict hardware-decoding requests to codecs reported as supported by the device.

### Subtitles and Text

#### Live Captions and AI Workflows

- **Playback-time transcription:** Generate subtitles in short, overlapping audio chunks rather than waiting for the whole media file to finish processing.
- **Seek-aware processing:** Cancel work for the old playback position when seeking and restart near the new position with bounded look-ahead, preventing obsolete captions from taking over the timeline.
- **Translated captions:** Optionally translate generated cues into the selected language, with source-text fallback when translation fails.
- **Speech providers:** Support the configured Groq, OpenAI, and OpenRouter speech-to-text paths. Keep model selections/catalogs per provider and refresh available model choices.
- **Generation reliability:** Improve SRT generation, ordered cue merging, bounded retries, temporary-audio cleanup, cancellation, and displayed generation/translation progress.

#### Tracks, Search, and Rendering

- Group audio tracks by source and make track selection metadata easier to scan.
- Move Primary/Secondary subtitle indicators to the trailing side beside external-track actions.
- When Primary is unchecked while Secondary is selected, promote Secondary into Primary, clear the secondary slot, and apply primary positioning.
- Preserve the familiar online-subtitle search controls and independently scrolling results while improving spacing.
- Improve downloaded subtitle filenames and external-file handling.
- Improve multilingual subtitle/lyrics rendering and default font fallback.
- Write the supported shared subtitle font-size option instead of an unsupported secondary font-size property, while retaining separate supported secondary positioning and scaling.
- Avoid unnecessary subtitle-text queries when no primary subtitle track is selected.

### Custom Themes, Wallpapers, and Settings Backups

#### Appearance Editors

- Added custom-theme creation, selection, editing, and deletion.
- Customize primary, secondary, tertiary, and background colors independently for light and dark appearance.
- Added dedicated theme and wallpaper editor screens, with live previews rather than requiring manual color or image-file editing.
- Added full-screen custom wallpapers with image selection, zoom, positioning, Fit/Fill behavior, blur up to 40 dp, and transparency controls.
- Preserve wallpaper configuration across startup and retain adjustments when reopening the editor.
- Improved custom-theme propagation, flatter folder presentation, and media-badge appearance.
- Fix light-theme visibility of 4K/HDR overlays and watched-progress fills on dark artwork scrims.

#### Portable Backups

- Store newly saved wallpapers as Base64 PNG data in the app's existing wallpaper preference.
- Include custom-theme colors, selected theme, wallpaper image, and wallpaper adjustments in settings exports.
- Convert accessible legacy file/content wallpaper references into embedded image data when exporting or importing.
- Keep large image data out of navigation state and avoid displaying encoded data as a filename.
- Preserve supplementary Unicode characters and string-set contents in the new backup format.
- Parse and validate imported preferences before applying them in one batch, preventing malformed XML or an invalid wallpaper from partially changing appearance settings.
- Preserve support for older backup formats and report invalid values instead of silently replacing them with defaults.
- Complete the XML snapshot before opening the export destination, preserve cancellation, and count imported network records only after insertion succeeds.
- Preserve the exclusion of device-bound network passwords; imported connections require credentials to be entered again.

### Library, Navigation, and Swipe Actions

#### Browsing and Layout

- **Adjustable grids:** Expose independent folder/video column controls in grid mode and give the network browser its own folder-column count rather than a fixed two-column layout.
- **Consistent cards:** Refine list/grid gutters, metadata fields, title gaps, badges, and cell-relative artwork sizing across local and network browsing.
- **Folder pinning:** Restore consistent pin/unpin behavior and improve folder sorting/presentation.
- **Search:** Migrate inline and remaining custom search fields to Material 3 search controls, including settings, mpv help, codec capabilities, and torrent selection. Improve IME Search handling, focus, and keyboard opening in music/network screens.
- **Stable navigation:** Retain the expanding navigation dock with stable slots, foreground-only interaction, and consistent transitions. Non-adjacent tab changes no longer animate through intermediate tabs, and Back returns through Home where appropriate.
- **Event-driven refresh:** Remove unnecessary resume-triggered work, observe real media and permission changes, and prevent stale scans from replacing newer results.
- **Folder NEW badges:** Keep one debounced, view-model-owned update path, cache folder membership for badge-only changes, and avoid recounts merely from returning to a tab. Cancelled work no longer replaces counts with temporary zeros.

#### Item Swipe Actions

- Added configurable left/right actions for supported local video, folder, and music rows.
- Available actions include None, watched-state toggle, Add to Playlist, Play Next, Add to Queue, Delete, Mark New, Last Played, Finished, and Clear History.
- Folder actions apply to the relevant media inside the folder, with confirmation and permission handling for destructive operations.
- Music folder actions collect audio files, while video folder actions retain their video scope. Grid, multi-selection, and unsupported-source restrictions remain in place.
- Preserve explicit New and cleared-history label state independently from automatic age/progress calculations.
- Added independent left/right swipe-zone widths from 1% to 50%, with a 25% default.
- Show each zone's actual percentage and proportional width in the settings preview.
- Choosing None releases that zone for tab navigation and shows 0%, while remembering the width for re-enabling.
- Capture only the enabled inward swipe from the appropriate physical edge; middle and outward gestures remain available to the tab pager.

#### Inner Tabs

- Enabled horizontal swiping between Music, Network, and Recents inner tabs.
- Added a Swipe between inner tabs setting without changing tap navigation or the main navigation pager.

### Android TV, External Displays, and Feedback

#### TV and External Screens

- Added partial Android TV support, including TV launcher metadata, D-pad focus handling, and remote-friendly onboarding, browsing, settings, and player controls.
- Improved focus and navigation through constrained player controls and sheets; touch-only row swipe actions remain disabled on television devices.
- Added configurable projection to Android presentation-capable external displays while retaining controls on the main device.
- Improve external-surface ownership, attachment, removal, and recovery instead of treating display changes as unrelated playback sessions.

#### Haptics and Motion

- Integrated Kmp-Vibrate and expanded meaningful feedback for selection, drag/reorder, player gestures, speed/equalizer controls, sliders, and playlist actions.
- Added a Haptic feedback preference and keep app/system opt-outs and device capabilities in control.
- Use adjustment landmarks and throttling rather than generating unrestricted feedback for every small value change.
- Refine selection indicators, action bars, playlist motion, player controls, and sheets using the shared Material motion policy and reduced-motion behavior.

### Settings, Scripting, and Configuration

- Organize network configuration and media-server management into their appropriate settings sections and remove the duplicated Autoplay next audio setting from Player settings.
- Improve settings summaries and search targets for relocated or newly added options, including gestures and swipe-zone widths.
- Cache mpv configuration for startup reuse and improve config/editor workflows.
- Treat the script master switch, selected Lua/JavaScript files, and configured directory as part of the native runtime configuration.
- Apply script disable/re-enable changes by rebuilding the player runtime with the current queue, position, and paused state, rather than leaving removed scripts running or loading duplicates.
- Keep mini-player and notification re-entry from bypassing a required script-runtime refresh, and prune disabled cached scripts even when the configured document tree is unavailable.
- Fix editor autocomplete placement around the on-screen keyboard across the shared mpv configuration and script editors.

### Reliability, Diagnostics, and Developer Changes

- Added playback and lifecycle Perfetto tracing.
- Removed blocking browser-side work before player launch and allowed a newer direct load to supersede a pending stop.
- Refined lifecycle ownership and background/foreground handoffs so activity changes, queued loads, and service state do not compete over the same playback session.
- Remove temporary auto-crop filters only when the app-owned filter is present, avoiding repeated missing-filter errors.
- Guard missing or unreadable wallpaper files and invalid image bounds before decoding.
- Integrated CrashX, stored crash reports, a dedicated debug-log viewer, and improved crash/recovery and report-preparation messages.
- Extend the database for downloads, server integrations, audiobook progress, playback marks, and shared bookmarks, with migrations that preserve existing data.
- Resolve native mpvlib variants from GitHub release artifacts instead of committing large AAR binaries to the repository.
- Updated Gradle, Android Gradle Plugin, Kotlin, KSP, Room, Compose, and Material dependencies.
- Added Dependabot configuration and refreshed checkout, Java setup, and release actions.

### Documentation, Website, and Translations

- Added the project website and expanded installation, feature, settings, and scripting documentation.
- Added branded website themes, refreshed screenshots/showcases, and improved light-mode contrast.
- Refined website deployment rules so preview and pull-request builds can be skipped while retaining production deployment.
- Audited the custom mpv command/scripting reference and expanded the user guides.
- Added citation metadata, repository contributor presentation, an in-app contributors section, and acknowledgments for upstream projects and adapted work.
- Expanded translations across Arabic, German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Japanese, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian, and Simplified Chinese.

### Upgrade Notes

- New settings backups use format version 2. This version imports older backups, but older app versions do not understand the new encoded string-set format.
- A legacy wallpaper must still be readable to embed it in a backup. Missing images cause export/import to report a failure instead of producing a falsely portable backup.
- Settings backups contain preferences and saved network-connection configuration, not a complete backup of media files or every library database table.
- Network passwords and Android storage permission grants are not transferred by settings export.
- Live transcription and translation use configured external providers, require suitable credentials/network access, and may incur provider charges. They are not an offline speech engine.
- Download availability, pause/resume support, external subtitles, and selected formats depend on the source and download engine. DRM-protected content is not unlocked by these features.
- Audiobook import does not bypass DRM, and metadata/chapter availability depends on the files and storage provider.
- Android TV support remains partial. Server features depend on the server's capabilities, permissions, and configuration.

## 2.5.0 - Frame Review, Auto Crop & Library Performance

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Project hiatus:** Following version 2.5.0, mpvRx development will be paused until further notice.

### 🎬 Frame Review, Seeking & Playback
- **Frame-Level Review**: Added a full-player Frame Review mode with horizontal frame swipes, previous/next-frame controls, precise frame and millisecond readouts, snapshots with optional subtitles, and a transparent responsive layout.
- **Frame-Addressed Timeline**: The Frame Review slider now selects integer video frames. Dragging uses throttled keyframe previews, while release performs an exact mpv seek with bounded refinement and adjacent-frame correction for precision without sustained decoder load.
- **Reliable Forward and Backward Seeking**: Backward seeks use exact targets to keep audio and video aligned. Forward seeks stop safely before EOF and a subsequent forward action can finish playback instead of becoming unresponsive near the end.
- **Safer Surface Recovery**: MediaCodec video is suspended before an Android playback surface is destroyed and restored only for the matching playback generation, reducing black frames and decoder failures after surface recreation.
- **thumbfast Seek Preview Removal**: Removed the separate ThumbFast overlay engine, frame-decode cache, preference, and UI. Scrubbing now uses one throttled live-video preview path, reducing duplicate decoder work and stale preview races.
- **Smoother Startup and Controls**: Reduced startup control flicker, replaced overshooting control springs with predictable timed transitions, and improved seek coalescing so rapid gestures settle on the latest requested position.
- **Correct Orientation from the First Frame**: Local videos pass their known dimensions into the player so portrait and landscape orientation can be selected before playback appears instead of rotating after startup.
- **Correct Audio State Across Transitions**: Playback teardown no longer carries a temporary seek mute into the next file, and terminal playback state is persisted immediately when a file reaches EOF.
- **Persistent Video Geometry**: Video zoom survives file loads, while crop, pan, zoom, stretch, and ambient rendering now share one consistent geometry path.
- **Immediate Runtime Changes**: Clearing playback history updates repository-backed state immediately, and edited enabled Lua scripts reload with the next player core.

### ✂️ Automatic Crop & Video Output
- **Automatic Black-Bar Cropping**: Added an Auto Crop aspect mode that samples multiple frames, detects persistent black borders conservatively, and caches results for repeat playback.
- **Variable-Aspect Safety**: Auto Crop now handles changing aspect ratios, source rotation, and short or dark scenes without retaining stale crop measurements.
- **Stretch and Ambient Compatibility**: Cropping works correctly in stretch layouts and updates the ambient background from the same final video geometry.
- **Translated Auto Crop Experience**: Auto Crop status, actions, results, and error messages are available across every supported app language.
- **Cleaner HDR Configuration**: Removed redundant tone-mapping and gamut-mapping overrides so HDR output follows the selected pipeline without conflicting transformations.

### 🎛️ Player Controls, PiP & Navigation
- **Onboarding Never Blocks the App**: "Get started" now always enters the app, even when permissions were skipped — the finish page lists any missing permissions in an amber warning instead of the quick-tour toggle, and screens that need storage show a compact in-place "Grant access" prompt.
- **Search Bar Respects the Status Bar**: The inline search bar (folders, videos, music, playlists, network, Jellyfin) no longer renders under the status bar and camera cutout — the system-inset padding lost in the Material search migration is back.
- **Streaming Link Handling Toggle**: New "Open streaming site links" switch in player settings controls whether mpvRx registers for YouTube, Vimeo, Twitch, Odysee, and Bilibili links — turn it off and those links go straight to their own apps while direct media URLs keep working.
- **Correct First Playlist Entry**: Opening any video other than the first from a folder no longer shows the opened video's name on the playlist sheet's first row — stale launch metadata from the temporary one-item queue is now cleared before the folder playlist is published.
- **Right-Edge Action Panel**: Added a bare right-edge pull handle that opens the complete player action set in the app's movable `DraggablePanel`.
- **Consistent Action Tiles**: Player actions use a responsive three-column tile layout with normalized icon sizes, no nested circular backgrounds, dynamic colors, and full-tile indicators for active settings such as Background Playback, HDR, Ambient, Repeat, Shuffle, transforms, speed, and zoom.
- **Swipe Speed Lock**: Added a hold-speed swipe gesture with locking, haptic feedback, and reliable restoration to 1x when the lock is released.
- **Configurable Audio Seeking**: Music-player rewind and forward controls now use the configured double-tap seek duration.
- **Reliable PiP Handoffs**: Expanding PiP restores the full player without interrupting playback, Back opens the mini player where appropriate, and the PiP close action stops playback cleanly.
- **Supported-Link Routing**: Expanded Open by default coverage for supported YouTube domains.
### 🌐 Network Streaming & Protocols
- **Auto-Next at End of File Restored**: Videos and music advance to the next queue item again when a file finishes — in the player and during background playback. A 2.5.0 change suppressed the end-of-file signal that keep-open builds rely on; it now flows again and is validated against the playback position so a dropped network stream can't fake it and skip mid-file.
- **Proxy Connection Slot Leak**: Timed-out network proxy operations no longer leave their late-arriving upstream streams open, which could exhaust small servers' connection limits and fail every following request.
- **WebDAV Playback Reliability**: Playback no longer fails outright on servers whose share root rejects or empties a depth-0 PROPFIND (common behind reverse proxies) — only credential rejections abort the connection now, and file sizes fall back to an HTTP HEAD/ranged probe when PROPFIND can't provide them. Failed proxy streams also recover: a dead upstream session is evicted so the next seek reconnects instead of buffering forever, and upstream failures are now logged (redacted) instead of silently returning 503.
- **No yt-dlp for Local Proxy Streams**: Loopback proxy URLs (all SMB/FTP/SFTP/WebDAV/torrent playback) are excluded from the yt-dlp hook outright, so extensionless network files can't be misrouted through the extractor.
- **YouTube on 32-bit and x86 Devices**: Fixed shared YouTube links failing with "could not load this link" on armeabi-v7a and x86 devices — the bundled Python runtime only shipped its arm64 build configuration, so yt-dlp crashed with "No module named \_sysconfigdata\_\_android\_..." before extraction could start.
- **SFTP Support**: Added SFTP as a full network protocol alongside SMB, FTP, and WebDAV — browse folders, stream with seeking through the secure loopback proxy, and manage connections from the same add/edit dialogs (default port 22).
- **Large-File Freeze & EOF Seek Fix**: Network reconnect options now reach the primary playback stream, so a dropped connection or a failed seek-reopen recovers automatically instead of freezing large files or showing endless buffering when seeking back after the end of a file.
- **Proxy Hang Guard**: A network body that ends early now surfaces as a recoverable disconnect instead of leaving the player waiting forever for missing bytes.
- **More Robust WebDAV Streaming**: Full-file streams reuse the shared HTTP client (consistent timeouts, no per-request client leak), and servers that ignore byte-range requests fall back to skip-to-offset streaming so seeking keeps working everywhere.
- **Music on Network Shares**: WebDAV, SMB, FTP, and SFTP browsers now show and play audio files when "Show audio in browser" is enabled, including folder queues and the audio-player interface.
- **Fewer Duplicate Requests**: Prevented duplicate network request bursts during playback startup.

### 🎬 Playback & Stability
- **Precise End-of-File Seeks**: Avoided non-precise seeks into EOF that could end playback unexpectedly.
- **Ambient Sheet Theming**: Fixed the Ambient sheet appearance in light mode.
- **Cleaner Builds**: Resolved Kotlin and Material API warnings and updated dependencies.

### � Onboarding & Quick Tour
- **Step-by-Step Permission Setup**: The first-run permission page is now a guided stepper — one permission per screen with progress dots, so everything fits any display without clipping. Optional permissions (notifications, audio) can be skipped individually, and skipping storage skips the whole permission flow.
- **Quick Tour Opt-In**: The final setup step offers a quick-tour toggle; the in-app tour itself ships in an upcoming release.

### �📋 Media Info
- **Image Details**: JPG, PNG, WebP, GIF, TIFF and other images now get a dedicated Image tab with resolution, format, bit depth, color space, compression, and orientation — including embedded cover images found inside audio and video files.
- **Other & Raw Tabs**: Timecode tracks, programs, and future MediaInfo section kinds appear in a new Other tab together with MKV attachment names, and the complete MediaInfo report is readable in-app from a Raw tab.
- **Full-Value Reader**: Tapping any field opens a scrollable, selectable popup with its complete value and a copy action, so long values are never lost to truncation.
- **Kind-Aware Overview**: Images show resolution, format, bit depth, and size; music shows duration, channels, sample rate, and bitrate; irrelevant placeholders such as "No Video" no longer appear.
- **Complete Container Metadata**: Every General field MediaInfo reports is listed, and the file's system path is shown both under the title and in the container card.

### 🌐 Network, Storage & Subtitles
- **Network Folder Bookmarks**: Save, open, and manage frequently used folders from saved SMB, FTP, and WebDAV connections without duplicating credentials.
- **Hardened WebDAV Playback**: Long-running streams are no longer cut off by a whole-call timeout, reserved filename characters are encoded exactly once, duplicate server entries are removed, and reverse-proxy hrefs resolve safely.
- **Network Subtitle Refresh**: External subtitles are discovered and refreshed correctly for WebDAV and other network media. Next/previous queue navigation now follows the current network item instead of reusing the first item's cached path.
- **Configurable Hidden Folders**: Added controls for including dot-prefixed and `.nomedia` folders that Android MediaStore normally omits.
- **Incremental Hidden Scanning**: Hidden-folder discovery now reuses indexed scan state and refreshes changed roots instead of repeatedly traversing the full storage tree.
- **Android 10 File Operations**: Restored rename, move, delete, and storage permission behavior on Android 10 while retaining scoped-storage handling on newer Android versions.
- **Cleaner Subtitle Colors**: Removed the duplicated subtitle background-color control so one setting owns the rendered value.

### 🎵 Music, Notifications, Lyrics & Playlists
- **Colloquial Hinglish Romanization**: Added a casual Latin-script lyrics option for Indic languages, including per-line mixed-script detection, Hindi schwa deletion, long-vowel handling, nasalization fixes, and cleaner Punjabi apostrophes.
- **No Stale Lyrics After Track Changes**: In-flight lyrics loading, source switching, and translation are cancelled and identity-checked so a slow previous track cannot overwrite the current song.
- **Reliable Notification Favorites**: Music notification favorites use the same stable identity as the app, update immediately, and stay synchronized with playlist changes.
- **Isolated Notification Controls**: Media notification actions now target the active playback session, include a close action, and avoid duplicate or cross-session commands.
- **Save Queue as Playlist**: The current player queue can be saved directly as a named playlist.
- **Faster Playlist Artwork**: Playlist rows reuse cached video thumbnails instead of regenerating artwork while browsing.
- **Relevant Queue Actions Only**: Play Next and Add to Queue remain available for audio selections without appearing in video selection menus where those actions are not supported.

### 📦 Installation
- **Obtainium Access**: Added a direct Obtainium badge and corrected setup link in the project README for easier installation and update tracking.

### ⚡ Library, Documentation & Stability
- **Smooth Large Libraries**: Lists containing hundreds of videos suspend thumbnail decoding, disk reads, and cache-key work during flings, then resume a bounded viewport batch after scrolling settles.
- **Incremental Playback Progress**: Five-second playback persistence updates only the affected library row instead of rebuilding and re-sorting every video, preserving stable lazy-list items and reducing mid-scroll jank.
- **Lower Per-Card Overhead**: Thumbnail preferences are observed once per screen, repository work runs off the main thread, and large video pickers use stable content types and scroll-aware loading.
- **Documentation Crash Fixed**: Fixed issue #571, where scrolling through mpv Input Command documentation crashed on the duplicated `COMMAND:playlist-next` lazy-list key. Playlist commands now appear once and all documentation rows have category-qualified unique keys.
- **More Reliable Player State**: Fixed playback-state updates that could lag behind user actions and improved queue, notification, and playlist synchronization during repeated media changes.

## 2.4.0 — Playlists, Playback Reliability & Expressive Navigation

### 🎬 Playback, PiP & Performance
- **Faster Video Startup**: Removed blocking external asset synchronization from the launch path. Validated internal mpv assets are reused immediately while external assets refresh after playback begins.
- **Reliable Seek Thumbnails**: Hardened ThumbFast-style preview initialization, request ordering, caching, and decode behavior so scrubbing shows the newest requested frame without stale replacements.
- **Clean PiP Dismissal**: Consolidated PiP close handling into one idempotent teardown path, preventing lingering playback, duplicated audio, and brief audio glitches after the PiP window is dismissed.

- **Restored Ambient Glow**: Brought back the proven v1.4.1 ambient glow shader and removed conflicting legacy ambient behavior.

### 🌐 Streaming Quality, yt-dlp & Subtitles
- **Per-Video Quality Selection**: Added a quality control for network streams and per-item yt-dlp format selection, with the chosen format carried through playback instead of applying one global guess.
- **Clearer Web Playback Status**: Improved yt-dlp web playback, resolver status feedback, and quality-button visibility across the player layouts.
- **Episode-Aware Subtitle Search**: SubHub searches now retain the current season and episode context when media moves through the playback pipeline.
- **Dedicated Subtitle Preferences**: Added a focused subtitle section to Settings so subtitle controls are easier to find and manage.

### 🍿 Jellyfin & Seerr

- **Reliable Tab Swiping**: Main browser navigation now uses the pager's settled page as its single source of truth, preventing interrupted swipes from leaving Recents and Playlists stuck between pages.
- **Synchronized Builds**: Standard, Fongmi, and non-Vulkan packages are built together from the same release tag and app source revision.

## 2.2.1 — Playback & Lyrics Hotfix

### 🎬 Video Playback Reliability
- **Black Screen on Startup Fixed**: Video output now waits for Android to attach a valid render surface before mpv initializes the renderer. This restores the proven 2.1.0 startup order and prevents `Missing surface pointer`, audio-only playback, and permanent `video=eof` states on slower devices, including Vivo devices running Android 16.
- **Safer Surface Recreation**: If the surface disappears while a file is loading, video selection is deferred until the replacement surface is attached instead of racing a destroyed native window.
- **Single Video-Restoration Path**: Removed duplicate Activity-level restoration state so `PlaybackSession` is the sole owner of deferred video selection.

### 🎤 Lyrics & Update Notes
- **Word-Timed Karaoke for Standard LRC**: Regular LRCLIB line-synced lyrics now receive stable per-word timing, so the active line animates word by word instead of displaying one static sentence. Enhanced LRC files keep their original word timestamps.
- **Consistent Centered Lyrics**: Normal and fullscreen lyrics now use the same centered layout for active lines, translations, and plain lyrics.
- **Maintained Markdown Renderer**: Update release notes now use the lightweight Material 3 Markdown renderer from Maven Central instead of a custom parser.

## 2.2.0 — Jellyfin, Torrent Series & Player Reliability Release

### 🪼 Jellyfin Streaming Integration

- **Richer Library Cards & Ratings**: Library cards now fetch real cover art and show IMDb star ratings, with Rotten Tomatoes ratings reorganized for readability and your libraries prioritized in the order you use them.
- **Faster, Smarter Library Browsing**: Libraries are queried by item type instead of slow folder traversal, with server-side genre filtering, prioritized Shows/Movies in search results, search debouncing, and direct breadcrumb navigation.
- **Episode Auto-Play & Next-Episode Overlay**: Series continue automatically with a next-episode overlay, audio/subtitle language sync between episodes, and an item info sheet for details before you play.
- **Two-Way Playback Sync**: Playback state (pause/resume/stop) is reported to the server in real time, and the app pulls your freshest watch position from Jellyfin before starting playback — resume works across devices.

### 🧲 Torrent Series & Network Streaming
- **Series Torrents Become a Real Playlist**: Multi-file torrents now appear as one playlist entry per episode (sorted naturally), so you can jump between episodes from the queue sheet, use next/previous, auto-advance at the end of an episode, and keep separate resume positions per file. Switching episodes restarts the stream on the right file automatically.
- **Media Tab Redesign**: The Torrent tab became the unified Media tab in JellyCine style — hero banner, resume carousel, poster cards, and a detail sheet — with saved torrent and network streams unified in one place and a save/open action on recent stream links.
- **Network Tabs Reorganized**: Tabs reordered to Local Network, Media, and Syncplay, with "Saved Links" naming and a streamlined Media tab UI.
- **Smarter Recents**: YouTube links now persist their real video titles and thumbnails into recents, and network streaming episode rows show proper episode titles with Jellyfin artwork fallback.

### 🎤 Lyrics & Audio Experience
- **Letter-by-Letter Karaoke Lyrics**: Synced lyrics now animate every single character on its own beat — letters rise into place with a pop, glow briefly, and sweep from dim to bright, driven by a frame-interpolated playback clock so the wave stays fluid even between position updates.
- **Centered Lyric Focus**: The active line glides to the center of the view (instead of sticking to the top) with a depth-of-field falloff — nearby lines stay readable while distant lines blur and fade. Fullscreen lyrics are center-aligned with larger type.
- **Visualizer Engine Cleanup**: All four visualizers (Galaxy, Blob, Cuboid, Particle) now share one audio analysis source of truth — beats, volume gating, and spectrum data are identical across styles, and a dead duplicate rendering engine was removed.
- **Audio Quality-of-Life**: New audio file picker with persistent folder selection, an autoplay-next-audio preference, immediate audio stop when closing the player, correct "now playing" highlight in the music list, and a crash fix when starting playback from the Songs tab.

### 🎬 Player Reliability & Playback Engine
- **Load Recovery & Watchdog**: Media that never becomes ready now times out with a visible error and automatic retry instead of hanging forever; playback also recovers cleanly after reopening the app, and end-file metadata edge cases no longer crash the session.
- **Resume Position Correctness**: Each video resumes from its own saved position — the next playlist item no longer inherits the previous video's progress, progress is persisted for the active playlist item, and history identity is unified for local files.
- **Subtitle Improvements**: Choose preferred subtitles by ordered title keywords (e.g. "Dialogue" before "Signs"), yt-dlp subtitle titles no longer confuse language filters, and subtitle scale/position now compensate correctly during GPU video zoom and pan (#395).
- **Skip Markers Fixed**: Intro/outro skip markers no longer accidentally advance to the next video, and marker metadata survives track changes.
- **Zero-Permission External Playback**: Files shared from other apps play via file descriptors without any storage permission, with robust fallbacks for content URIs.
- **mpv.conf Option Ownership Page**: A dedicated, organized settings page (replacing the old popup) to hand specific option groups — renderer, decoder, shaders, subtitles, and more — over to your mpv.conf, with per-option control, live counts, and one-tap reset.

### 🧭 UI, Navigation & Updates
- **Expressive Adaptive Navigation Bar**: New Material 3 expressive navbar that sizes its pill to the actual content, adapts between phone and tablet instead of cramming six tabs, and centers correctly on launch.
- **Codec Support Indicators**: Per-video decoder support badges across browsing screens and a cleaned-up codec capabilities page, so you can see hardware vs. software decode support at a glance.
- **In-App Updates Get a Bottom Sheet**: The update dialog was replaced with a modern bottom sheet that renders release notes as formatted Markdown (headings, lists, bold, links) with version chips, release date, size, and download progress.
- **Picture-in-Picture Polish**: The media notification now stays available in PiP mode (#402).

### ⚡ Performance, Networking & Stability
- **One Shared HTTP Stack**: The bundled libcurl was replaced by the app-wide OkHttp client (scripts, Jellyfin reporting, subtitles all included), reducing native footprint and unifying cookies, headers, and TLS handling.
- **ANR & Leak Fixes**: Fixed a teardown ANR, audio-focus races, and an HLS credential leak; preference listeners are now shared instead of one per collector.
- **Snappier Lists**: Recently-played lookups are indexed, per-render date formatters were hoisted, recompositions were trimmed in Jellyfin browsing, and the library scrollbar no longer overlaps content.
- **Cleaner Codebase**: The project was reorganized along MVVM lines (update feature split into domain/UI layers, domain no longer depends on UI), every compiler warning was fixed, and dead code was removed.

- **Hitbox & Gesture Adjustments**: Dynamic multi-line wrapped text hitbox calculations under zoom/pan, option to invert swipe subtitle gesture direction, and automatic secondary subtitle position offset using primary hitbox to prevent overlap.
- **Subtitle Track Roles**: Subtitle track sheet now displays track roles (primary/secondary) for multi-role subtitle tracks.
- **Stream Subtitle Fix**: Subtitles load reliably on network streams without breaking background playback.
- **Korean Subtitle Fix**: Fixed broken Korean Jamo rendering using NFC Unicode normalization.
- **Subtitle Persistence & Search Keyboard Fix**: Subtitles persist across sessions reliably (`addSubtitleSuspend`), and soft keyboard no longer covers the subtitle search dialog (`adjustResize`).

### ⚙️ Settings, Lifecycle, i18n & Binary Footprint

- **App Language Preference**: Added per-app language selection independent of system language settings.
- **Redesigned Permission Setup**: Storage permission page redesigned with separate File & Notification sections and a guided Next-button flow, now responsive across screen sizes.
- **mpv Config Validation**: The config editor validates `mpv.conf` before saving and properly closes editor streams to avoid file lockups.
- **Folder Deletion Behavior**: Media-only deletion mode by default (removes video/audio files while protecting documents/images) with full recursive deletion toggle in settings.
- **Unified Background Playback Lifecycle**: Streamlined PiP transitions, screen lock/unlock handling, and task removal behavior for Android 15/16.
- **Android 16 Compatibility**: Native libmpv subprocess handling updated for Android 16, with a cache-safe, coordinated MPV teardown process.
- **Binary Footprint Optimization**: Removed ~50 MB of unused `libpython_bin.so` binaries across all CPU architectures.

## 1.5.0-preview.5 — Preview Release

### Syncplay
- **Synchronized room playback**: Added Syncplay server, room, username, and optional password controls to Network Streaming.
- **Live player integration**: Local pause, resume, seek, file, and playback-position changes are shared with the room, while remote room updates are applied to mpv.
- **Protocol compatibility fixes**: Added the legacy and real protocol version handshake fields, MD5 server-password handling, latency compensation, user-list updates, and `ignoringOnTheFly` feedback suppression.
- **Localized interface**: Extracted all Syncplay UI text into Android resources and translated it for Arabic, German, Spanish, French, Japanese, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian, and Simplified Chinese.

### Google Cast
- **Native Cast control**: Added the standard stateful Google Cast button to portrait and landscape player controls, including a one-time layout migration for existing users.
- **Local and remote media handoff**: Receiver-accessible HTTP(S) streams are loaded directly; Android-local `file://` and `content://` media use a tokenized temporary LAN server with byte-range seeking and CORS support.
- **Playback continuity**: The sender transfers title, play state, duration, and current position, pauses local playback after a successful receiver load, and restores local playback at the receiver position when casting ends.
- **Complete sender controls**: Added Cast SDK expanded controls, notification/lock-screen integration, reconnection support, and receiver volume controls.
- **Receiver compatibility guardrail**: Casting uses Google's Default Media Receiver, so containers and codecs unsupported by the selected TV/Chromecast are not transcoded automatically.

### Playback Lifecycle & Background Playback
- **One background playback switch**: Audio preferences and the player background button now control the same persistent setting for both audio and video.
- **Reliable screen lock and unlock handling**: Playback now follows the selected background policy across screen-off, lock-screen, unlock, and resume transitions without losing the prior play state.
- **PiP lifecycle coordination**: Picture-in-picture transitions, PiP dismissal, screen locking while in PiP, and activity teardown now share one lifecycle policy instead of competing playback paths.
- **Persistent task-removal playback**: Swiping the app out of Recents no longer kills an active foreground playback session, so background audio continues until explicitly stopped.
- **Foreground service cleanup**: Disabling background playback immediately pauses playback and stops its foreground service and notification.
- **Preference migration**: Existing users who enabled the legacy audio-only screen-lock option are migrated to the unified background playback setting.

### Subtitle Search
- **Results appear as they arrive**: Online subtitle results are merged into the list as each selected SubHub source or Wyzie completes instead of waiting for every request.
- **Race-free repeat searches**: Starting another subtitle search cancels the previous request and clears stale results before streaming the new matches.

### Playback Engine
- **Updated bundled mpvlib**: Refreshed the packaged `mpvlib.aar` used by all preview APK variants.

### Media Library & Audio Browsing
- **Preference-aware media switch**: The Video/Audio selector appears only when audio browsing is enabled, remembers the selected library type, and resets to Video when audio browsing is disabled.
- **Complete audio playlists**: Audio launches now populate the active playlist so previous and next controls update and navigate correctly.
- **Square audio artwork**: Audio thumbnails use a square presentation in both grid and list cards while video thumbnails remain 16:9.
- **Audio-safe editing**: Video compression actions are hidden for audio selections and guarded from opening with audio files.

### Player Polish
- **Rounded streaming cache indicator**: Buffered seekbar progress is clipped to the same pill-shaped ends as the normal seek track.
- **Smoother natural visualizer**: Higher-rate spectrum capture, tuned frequency envelopes, frame-time-aware interpolation, and responsive beat decay make the audio blob react fluidly without harsh jumps.

### AI Providers & Smart Tools
- **Current provider protocols**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, OpenRouter, Together, and OpenCode Zen requests now follow their current API shapes; OpenCode models are routed through Responses, Messages, Gemini, or Chat Completions as required.
- **Resilient response parsing**: Text, multipart content, reasoning blocks, citations, provider errors, and both object- and array-based model lists are parsed without relying on one rigid response schema.
- **Thinking-model rename fixes**: AI rename and subtitle-title output now discard reasoning and code fences, accept structured JSON fields, preserve extensions, and reject empty or unsafe names.
- **Provider-specific model memory**: Each provider keeps its own selected model and cached model list, preventing stale selections when switching services.
- **Correct speech endpoints**: Groq and OpenAI use supported transcription models, while OpenRouter speech requests use its current base64 JSON audio format.

## 1.5.0-preview.3 — Preview Release

### Playback Hotfix
- **Audio and video transitions rebuilt**: Every item is loaded with file-local video-track selection, preventing audio state from producing a black screen on the next video.
- **Reliable next-item playback**: Runtime navigation now sends an actual mpv `loadfile` replacement and clears the previous EOF pause state.
- **Preference-safe EOF handling**: Autoplay, Repeat One, Repeat All, Shuffle, playlist mode, and close-at-end now behave consistently, including very short audio files.
- **Safe seeking**: Audio never enters the native video-thumbnail path, and video thumbnails are generated only on demand while scrubbing—not automatically during file load.
- **Separated render surfaces**: The blob surface is mounted only for media independently identified as audio, preventing it from covering video during track-list transitions.
- **True beat response**: With audio-capture permission, real FFT data exclusively drives the blob; brightness and bloom are reduced while bass onsets pulse more clearly.

### 🔊 Audio Blob Visualizer
- **OpenGL ES 3.0 blob visualizer** — when playing audio without cover art, a reactive 3D blob appears behind the player controls. The blob morphs, pulses, and shifts color based on audio energy with a bloom/glow post-process.
- **Touch rotation**: Drag the blob to rotate it in 3D.
- **Pinch zoom fixed**: The blob now properly shrinks/enlarges when pinching — `pinchScaleFromRenderer()` was hardcoded to always return `1f`, resetting zoom on every new gesture.
- **Smaller default size**: Camera distance increased so the blob fits cleanly within screen bounds instead of nearly filling the height.
- **Audio Preferences toggle**: New "Audio blob visualizer" switch in Settings > Audio to enable or disable it.
- **Audio filter setting moved**: Audio filter (compressor/equalizer) options now live in Audio Preferences instead of the player's MoreSheet.

### 🎬 yt-dlp Changes
- **Audio quality preferences**: Independent bitrate caps for `Auto`, 64, 128, 192, and 256 kbps — composed with existing codec, resolution, FPS, HDR, and container selectors.
- **Serialized URL loading**: Initial and replacement URL loads now use one cancellable serialized job, preventing overlapping libmpv commands when links are pasted rapidly.
- **Graceful error recovery**: Recoverable URL load failures return to the player UI with an error message instead of escaping to the process-wide crash handler.
- **Audio quality removed from MoreSheet**: yt-dlp audio quality selector moved from the player's MoreSheet to yt-dlp settings.

### 📻 Audio Browsing
- **MediaStore + filesystem discovery** for common audio formats, neutral media counts, audio MIME mapping, and Android 13 `READ_MEDIA_AUDIO` permission handling.
- **Audio cards** show metadata titles, embedded cover artwork when available (via `audio-display=embedded-first`), and a music-note fallback icon.
- **Portrait-only playback** — audio files force sensor-portrait orientation and prevent the rotation action from switching back to landscape.
- **Sibling playlist includes audio** — when "Include audio" is on, the next/previous track list includes audio files from the same folder.
- **Audio icon placeholder fix**: Exported icon now displays correctly for audio files without cover art.
- **Audio pitch correction fix**: Pitch correction no longer persists when switching to a new video — resets to default per-file.
- **Audio autoplay race condition fixed**: Eliminated a race condition that could cause audio files to fail starting playback.

### 🌐 Network & External Playback
- **WebDAV PROPFIND fix**: Connection checks now use a depth-zero `PROPFIND` request instead of Sardine's `HEAD`-based `exists()` call, making it work with servers like FileBrowser Quantum that reject `HEAD` on DAV collections.
- **WebDAV trailing slash**: Collection URLs consistently keep a trailing slash during validation and browsing.
- **External-player discovery**: Added a MIME-only intent filter so external-player pickers can find mpvRx before attaching the final video or audio URI.
- **More protocol support**: Added `gopher://`, `sctp://`, and `data://` to network stream detection and intent filters.
- **Stream compatibility improved**: Better handling of edge-case media streams and improved browsing reliability.

### 🌲 Tree View Navigation
- **Configurable path compression**: New `Off`, 1–5, and `Unlimited` choices for single-child folder flattening. Applied independently per navigation step, preserving predictable physical paths. Tree View refreshes instantly when the depth changes.

### 🎨 Icon Consistency
- Converted all three `painterResource(R.drawable.ic_material_symbols_check)` usages to `Icons.Default.Check` through the app's `AppIcon` / `Icon` system.
- `SectionHeader.leadingIcon` and `CompactExpressiveIconButton.imageVector` now accept `AppIcon` instead of raw `ImageVector`, keeping everything on the unified icon pipeline.

### 🔊 Audio Playback Runtime Fixes
- **`local_media_path` extra**: Internal launches now pass the resolved filesystem path alongside the content URI, giving mpv a reliable fallback when `content://` URIs fail.
- **Serialized load dispatcher**: Added a dedicated `Dispatchers.Default.limitedParallelism(1)` dispatcher for media loading — prevents race conditions when queuing multiple load commands.
- **`vid=auto` before playback**: Non-M3U file loads explicitly reset the video track to auto before loading, avoiding "no video track" state from previous audio-only plays.
- **`audio-display=embedded-first`**: Enabled MPV's embedded cover art rendering for audio files.
- **Orientation on audio launch**: `setOrientation()` checks `isKnownAudioLaunch()` immediately, before the track-list event settles — fixes the black-screen + landscape glitch on audio start.
- **Subtitle "Off" option**: Added an explicit "Off" choice in the player subtitle sheet so users can disable subtitles without cycling through all tracks.

### 🗑️ Folder Deletion Behavior
- **Media-only deletion (default)**: Deleting a folder now only removes audio/video files — other files (images, logs, documents) are left untouched.
- **"Delete folder + all contents" toggle**: New option in Appearance Settings > File Browser to switch back to full recursive deletion when needed.
- **Album View cleanup fix**: Fixed an issue where the last video file in a folder was deleted but the empty folder remained.

### 📱 Tablet & Display
- **Dynamic refresh rate**: The player can now dynamically adjust the display refresh rate to match the video frame rate for smoother playback.
- **Dual-pane navigation fix**: Resolved a state leak that could cause crashes when navigating in tablet dual-pane mode.
- **Dual-pane settings button hidden**: The redundant settings button is no longer shown in dual-pane mode on tablets.
- **Folder card height fix**: Manual grid column counts now align properly with folder card heights in dual-pane layout.

### 🔍 Settings Search
- **Search history**: Recently searched terms are saved and displayed for quick re-selection.
- **Search suggestions**: The search field now shows contextual suggestions as you type.
- **Reflection-based fallback**: Settings search can dynamically discover settings via reflection when static indices are incomplete.



## 1.5.0-preview.2 — Preview Release

### 📦 MpvLib Update
- Updated mpv library and its dependencies

### ⚡ Performance & Startup
- **Faster video open**: Opening a video file now uses `Dispatchers.Default` for the `playFile()` call — keeps the UI thread free and the player starts faster
- **Leaner startup sync**: The MPV directory sync no longer blanket-copies `shaders/` and `fonts/` on every launch — only config files, scripts, and `script-opts/` are synced upfront. Shaders referenced in `mpv.conf` are pulled on demand via `syncReferencedShaders()`, and fonts are handled by the font manager. This cuts down startup time noticeably, especially for users with large shader packs
- **Removed Dynamic Speed Overlay**: The old `SpeedControlSlider` (a full-size overlay with a dot-track slider) and `CompactSpeedIndicator` are gone. Hold-speed is now shown as a simple, clean text pill (e.g. "2x"). The `showDynamicSpeedOverlay` preference has been removed too — no more toggles, no more clutter
- **Snap-to-preset hold speed**: The hold-speed gesture now snaps to fixed presets (0.5x → 1x → 1.5x → 2x → 2.5x → 3x → 3.5x → 4x) instead of a free-form slider. The settings slider also snaps to these values, so what you see is what you get
- **Hold speed range capped**: Boost speed is now capped at 0.5x–4x range (previously went up to 6x)

### 📱 Tablet Dual-Pane Layouts
- **Folder view dual pane**: On tablets (600dp+ smallest screen width), you can now see your folder list on the left and a video list on the right — tap a folder, see its contents immediately beside it. A new "Dual Pane View" toggle in Appearance Settings lets you turn this on/off
- **Settings dual pane**: The Settings screen also gets a two-panel layout on tablets — the section list stays on the left, and the selected settings page opens on the right. The currently active section is highlighted with a subtle background
- **Back navigation in dual pane**: Pressing back in dual-pane mode deselects the folder/settings page instead of closing the screen

### 🎥 Player & Subtitles
- **Invert swipe subtitle direction**: New "Invert swipe subtitles direction" setting in Gesture Preferences. When enabled, swiping left-to-right seeks backward and right-to-left seeks forward — useful if you prefer the mirrored behaviour
- **Screenshot overhaul**: Screenshot filename templates got a proper rework:
  - `%wH`, `%wM`, `%wS`, `%wT` now use the **video playback position** (not the wall clock time) — so screenshot filenames actually match the video timestamp
  - New template placeholders: `%F` (filename without extension), `%P` (position as `HH:MM:SS.mmm`), `%p` (position as `HH:MM:SS`)
  - `%f` now resolves from the actual filename first, falling back to media-title — more reliable naming
- **Korean Jamo subtitle fix**: Downloaded subtitles that use Korean Jamo (composite characters) now go through NFC Unicode normalization. No more broken/corrupted Korean glyphs in subtitles
- **Subtitle search keyboard fix**: Added `android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize"` to PlayerActivity — the subtitle search dialog no longer gets hidden behind the on-screen keyboard
- **Subtitle persistence fix**: External subtitles and subtitle settings now survive across playback sessions more reliably. Added `addSubtitleSuspend()` (suspend version) for better coroutine handling during subtitle loading
- **Cache indicator fix**: The buffered range on the seekbar no longer double-counts the played portion — it now shows the correct remaining buffer ahead of the playhead
- **Color hex fix**: `toColorHexString()` now manually extracts ARGB components instead of using `Int.toHexString()` which produced wrong values for some colors

### 🛠️ Lua Script Improvements
- **Lua `require()` support**: Custom Lua scripts using `require()` can now find modules in `script-modules/` subdirectories. The app recursively syncs helper folders from `scripts/` to internal storage, so Lua's C-level `fopen()` can actually read them. Modules are also cleaned up when scripts are disabled in settings

### 🧹 Cleanup
- **Removed libpython binaries**: Deleted ~50 MB of unused `libpython_bin.so` files from all 4 architectures — they were never loaded by the app
- **Simplified MPV version display**: Removed the `cleanBundledMpvVersion()` hack in CrashActivity — MPV version now shows cleanly without needing string patching
- **Fonts folder no longer auto-set**: When changing the base storage root, the fonts folder preference is no longer blindly overwritten — it's only cleared if it was pointing at the old root. This prevents accidental font-folder resets

## 1.5.0-preview.1 — Preview Release

### 📦 MpvLib Update
- Updated mpv library and its dependencies 

### ⚡ Performance & Stability
- **Startup optimization**: Deferred cold-start DB initialization, grammar pre-load, and auto-update check to cut first-frame time significantly
- **Memory leak fixes**: Plugged 5 memory leaks across PlayerActivity (screen-state receiver), PlayerViewModel (LRU caches, temp subtitle cleanup), MediaPlaybackService (bitmap leak), MainActivity (unused scope), and NetworkLifecycleObserver (uncancelled coroutine)
- **UI smoothness**: Optimized seekbar spring animation, precomputed skip-segment colors, memoized immutable copies in PlayerControls, hoisted per-card preference collectors
- **Player crash fix**: Resolved a crash in PlayerActivity during stream initialization
- **Streaming optimizations**: Load network streams on `Dispatchers.IO` instead of Default to reduce CPU pool contention

### 🎨 UI/UX Improvements
- **Dynamic Grids**: Added responsive grid layouts — auto-adjusts column count based on screen width across FileSystemBrowser, FolderList, VideoList, Playlist, and RecentlyPlayed screens
- **Centered controls**: Play/pause and navigation buttons now center in portrait mode
- **Haptic feedback**: Sort dialog sliders now provide haptic ticks on snap
- **Slider layout**: Column sliders placed side-by-side for better space usage
- **Theme refresh**: Boosted container saturation and surface tints across all themes (light/dark) for vivid, non-washed-out appearance
- **Subtitle sheet redesign**: Inline SeriesSelectionControls directly in the OnlineSubtitleSearchSheet search row
- **Compressor back-press fix**: Video compressor overlay now handles system back press correctly

### 🎥 Player & Streaming
- **HLS/DASH streaming fix**: Direct media URLs (.m3u8/.mpd/.mp4/.ts) now bypass yt-dlp and use mpv's native ffmpeg HLS demuxer — these streams previously failed in yt-dlp's generic extractor
- **yt-dlp audio selection**: New audio track selector in the yt-dlp panel; preferred languages sanitization for better auto-selection
- **Collapsible advanced settings**: YtdlpSettingsScreen now organizes advanced options under collapsible sections
- **Console option**: Added Console toggle in MoreSheet stats rows — opens the mpv debug console via script-message
- **Subtitle hitbox fixes**: Dynamic hitbox detection for multi-line wrapped text; fixed hitbox under zoom/pan; lowered minimum subtitle scale limit
- **Subtitle loading fix**: Fixed subtitle loading and player overlay issues with IntentSubtitleLoadPolicy and M3uPlaybackPolicy
- **Negative brightness**: Added negative brightness range support in vertical sliders
- **Streaming overlays**: Fixed streaming playback overlays and thumbnail rendering

### 🔍 Anime Skip Provider
- New **Anime Skip** provider (api.anime-skip.com GraphQL) for intro/ending detection — searches via MAL ID, pairs consecutive timestamps
- Removed dead db.videasy.net TMDB mirror (providers now skip IMDB resolution without it)
- Cleaned up WyzieSearchRepository: removed fallback mirror logic and dead VideasyTmdbTrendingResponse

### 📁 Media Search Engine
- **New MediaSearchEngine**: Dedicated search engine for searching files/folders with optimized indexing
- **FolderListScreen integration**: Search across folders and videos using the new engine with VideoFolder references
- **Multiple refactors**: Cleaned up search logic, improved readability, and added Kotlin smart-casting clarifications

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed Crashing issue of MpvRx , in a nutshell Ambient mode and Custom lua were not initialized in Sync causing to crash player sometimes
- That's all for Today Adiosss!!

## 1.3.7

- **Updated Wyzie subtitle API integration** — Synced with latest Wyzie API changes: added `ai` field for AI-translated subtitle detection, updated provider sources list (removed `subdl`, `podnapisi`, `ajatttools`; added `tvsubtitles`), and fixed TMDB endpoints to include API key authentication.
- **Material 3 Expressive Design** — Complete visual overhaul using Material 3 Expressive design system for a more modern, fluid, and engaging experience
- **Smoother Animations** — Replaced rigid linear transitions with spring-based physics animations throughout the app (navigation, controls, browser, dialogs)
- Added Voltage Battery Temperature And improved the style of Page 6 
- Added Optimized Ambient Mode with Eco Battery Saver Mode who want to take feel of Ambient without much Battery Impact
- Removed Dead Code and also Optimized some File Handling / Ui Rendering Operations
- **Settings export now stores app version**  exported XML files include the app version, so import dialogs show the correct version instead of "unknown".
- **HEVC 10bit thumbnails**  added a software-decoder fallback using Android's MediaCodec API. When the system can't decode a video frame (e.g. HEVC 10bit on devices without hardware support), the app now tries Google's software decoder before giving up. This means more thumbnails will show up on devices with limited codec support ( To be tested Propelry on unsupported device).
- **Fixed app icon on Android 16**  changed the adaptive icon background from transparent to opaque black so the icon doesn't disappear on launchers that don't handle transparency well.
- **User mpv.conf now has highest priority**  during player startup, your mpv.conf settings are re-applied after all app defaults so they always take precedence. but some of the Hardcoded things doesnt change like for example `sid, aid`.
- 

## 1.3.6

- **Six AI providers, one gorgeous settings page**  OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, and Together joined Groq and Gemini in a completely redesigned UI. Every provider gets its own API key, every single model is visible (free ones get a bold green badge), and the new searchable model picker sorts free models to the top. The offline model experience got a premium card-based overhaul too  tiers, speed/translation badges, device recommendations, DeepSeek-R1 support, reasoning toggles, and a benchmark button for downloaded models. One-tap download, delete, and switch between models without ever leaving the screen.

- **Subtitle translation**  SUPPORTS ASS Subs Translation tooooooooo..... , you can now configure your target languages once in settings. One language means one tap to translate. Two or more means a clean picker showing only the languages you chose. Translation progress appears right on the video screen (even with the sheet closed), partially translated subs survive restarts, and a red X lets you cancel mid-translation instantly. When using local models, the system automatically picks the best downloaded model for each language, keeps it warm between chunks, and never runs two local AI jobs at once.

- **Generate subtitles from video audio**  **_(EXPERIMENTAL)_** This is work in progress might not work Don't baby Cry that this shit aint working ,i ain't getting paid enough to implement this whole heartedly , so what it does is -> one tap generates subtitles using the audio you're already playing. Media3 extraction feeds Groq, Gemini, or offline Whisper, and the resulting SRT/VTT saves automatically.

- **Smarter AI across the board**  reasoning tags are automatically stripped from final results, token limits prevent stalls in heavy tasks, and every AI feature (rename, formatting, translation) comes with customizable prompts that fall back gracefully to built-in instructions.

- **Real-time subtitle toggle**  new on/off switch in AI settings to control real-time subtitle generation from audio. When off, the indicator and generate button are hidden from the player.

- **AI features respect the master switch**  turning off AI Integration now hides all AI indicators (translation, real-time subs) and buttons (generate, translate, format) from the player view. Renamed "AI Subtitle Search Formatting" to "AI Search" for clarity.


## 1.3.5

- **Removed Play Store and F-Droid build variants**  streamlined to a single `standard` flavor with full update support and all features enabled.
- **Revamped README**  comprehensive feature documentation organized by category, UPI QR code and Buy Me a Coffee links in the Support section.
- **SMB Network Thumbnail Generation**  fixed thumbnail generation for SMB shares through Codex AI (Beta).
- **Bulk AI Rename**  rename multiple files at once using Gemini or Groq with concurrency limiting and edge case handling.
- **AI Subtitle Translation**  translate subtitles using AI providers with custom prompts, progress indication, and user preference management.
- **AI Subtitle Translation Enhancements**  in-house developed translation pipeline with fully customizable prompts and per-user preference overrides.

## 1.3.4

- Capped generated thumbnails to safer preview sizes so large videos do not waste memory while browsing.
- Improved MKV/WebM thumbnail handling, including embedded artwork and smarter fallback frames.
- Cleaned old thumbnail cache paths when clearing thumbnail cache.

- Added Window Offset to prevent Camera notch overlap issues


## 1.3.3

- Fixed Background Playback and Pip issues 
- Anime4K should feel much smoother now. The player now uses the clean six-preset Anime4K flow from the reference app and avoids piling old shader work on top of the new preset when you switch modes.
- Anime4K is still off by default, but when you turn it on the picker is simpler: Off, A, B, C, A+, B+, and C+.
- Moved the Fast / Balanced / High Anime4K choice into Decoder settings, with Balanced as the default.
- Removed frame interpolation because it added a lot of GPU load and did not add enough real value.
- Removed the old OneThird and Halfway thumbnail choices.
- Removed the unused old player screen path.
- Cleaned up the track sheets so audio, subtitle, chapter, decoder, and online subtitle lists no longer depend on the old generic sheet.
- Removed SubDL from subtitle search sources.
- Network streaming is now opt-in instead of being enabled on a fresh install.
- HDR and Ambient controls are no longer placed on the default player buttons, so heavy visual extras stay out of the way unless you add them yourself.
- Turning HDR on now starts with Linear HDR by default.
- The app now does less background media scanning and cache cleanup on startup, which should help large libraries open with less churn.
- Added new MpvLib File with Some Optimization and Removing Deprecated Andorid Versions
- Thumbnails are now Loaded Faster and more Precisly

## 1.3.2

### HDR hdr-toys Pipeline

- Replaced the old 3-mode HDR system (Off / SDR with HDR / Normal HDR) with a proper shader-based pipeline powered by [hdr-toys](https://github.com/natural-harmonia-gropius/hdr-toys).
- Four HDR modes are now available: **BT.2100 PQ** (HDR10), **BT.2100 HLG**, **BT.2020**, and **Linear HDR** (mpv-native, no shaders).
- 77 GLSL shaders are bundled in the app and copied to the mpv config directory on first use  no manual setup required.
- The HDR panel no longer shows an "Off" option. Off is the default and is toggled by the HDR button; the panel only presents the four active modes.
- Selecting a mode while GPU Next + Vulkan is unavailable shows a clear error pill and falls back to Off safely.
- Added `boostSdrToHdr` preference (used by the Linear HDR path).
- `HdrToysManager` cleanly removes all hdr-toys shaders when switching to Off or when the pipeline is not ready, so no stale shaders leak between sessions.

### Thermal & Battery Improvements

- Added `ThermalMonitor`  samples `PowerManager.getThermalHeadroom()` (Android 11+) every 10 seconds during playback.
- Ambient shader sample budget is automatically capped based on thermal headroom: 8 samples (severe), 12 (moderate), 18 (mild), uncapped (cool).
- Anime4K is proactively downgraded to C/Fast when thermal headroom drops below 40%, before frame drops even start.
- Ambient shader recompilation is now skipped when all parameters are identical to the last compiled version  reduces unnecessary GPU stutter on orientation changes and no-op callbacks.
- Removed redundant dual position polling: the event-driven `time-pos` observer and the polling loop were both updating the same StateFlow, causing double seek-bar recompositions on every MPV event.
- Background playback position poll interval halved from 250 ms to 500 ms when controls are not visible, cutting idle JNI wake-ups by 50%.

### Stats Page 6  Fixes

- **GPU estimate bar fixed**: was using cumulative drop + delay totals that drifted to 100% after long sessions and added a fixed FPS-proportional baseline (120fps with zero drops showed 70% GPU load). Now uses per-second delta counts relative to the current frame rate  0 drops = 0%, all frames dropped = 100%.
- **CPU label corrected**: relabelled from "CPU Usage" to "App CPU (this process)" to accurately reflect that `getElapsedCpuTime()` measures only MpvRx's own process, not the whole device.
- **Frame drop text now shows per-second deltas** alongside the all-time totals, so you can tell current rendering pressure at a glance.
- **Pause-aware poll backoff**: the stats loop backs off from 1 s to 2 s intervals when playback is paused, cutting pointless JNI calls when metrics are static.

### Gesture & Action Overlay Toggles

- Added a new **"Gesture & Action Overlays"** section in Player Settings with seven independent on/off switches:
  - **Volume slider overlay**  vertical pill shown during volume swipe
  - **Brightness slider overlay**  vertical pill shown during brightness swipe
  - **Hold speed overlay**  speed badge and slider shown during long-press speed boost
  - **Aspect ratio feedback**  pill shown when cycling aspect ratio
  - **Zoom level feedback**  pill shown when pinching to zoom
  - **Repeat & shuffle feedback**  pill shown when toggling repeat or shuffle
  - **Action feedback pills**  brief text pills from custom buttons, ambient toggle, subtitle drag, and Lua/JS scripts
- All overlays default to **on**, so existing behaviour is unchanged until the user opts out.
- Disabling an overlay suppresses only the visual pill  the underlying gesture action (volume change, speed change, etc.) still happens normally.

- Long-pressing the HDR button now opens an HDR Output panel with Off, SDR with HDR, and Normal HDR modes.
- Media title resolution improved: MPV's resolved title is preferred for non-direct-media URLs and when the current filename looks like a generic route (e.g., `/watch`, `/stream`).
- Updated mpv library dependency from `mpv-android-lib-v0.0.1.aar` to `mpvlib.aar` and removed the old AAR.
- Added Multiple new provider to Wyzie subtitle sources.
- PiP and background playback now save the latest watched position instead of returning to the timestamp from before PiP started.
